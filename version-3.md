Siri Version 3 - Statement :
##

The development of Siri Version 3 has begun. During the development, you may experience outages and bugs with the bot.
If you do experience bugs, please report them in the #report-bugs channel (Siri support server).

Things you may see in V3:
- Moderation Category (mod commands, logs, automod, etc)
- Major Design improvements
- Utility revamp
- Bug fixes in all categories

If you would like to suggest more categories/commands/etc, please suggest them in the #suggestions channel (Siri support server).

I will also try my very best to get Siri in more servers, meaning even more motivation for updates.

Stay tuned!
